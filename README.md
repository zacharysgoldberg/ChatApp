## Disclaimer:

While ChatApp may not boast cutting-edge web design, its focus lies in backend scalability and optimization. The project aims to deliver robust functionality and performance rather than visual flair.

Additionally, there are considerations for developing a mobile app using .NET MAUI to further extend the application's reach and versatility.
